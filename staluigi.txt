1. Generating distribution archives
1.1 Make sure you have the latest version of PyPA’s build installed:

Windows: py -m pip install --upgrade build
Linux: python3 -m pip install --upgrade build

1.2 Now run this command from the same directory where pyproject.toml is located:

Windows: py -m build
Linux: python3 -m build

2. Uploading the distribution archives
Now that you are registered, you can use twine to upload the distribution packages. You’ll need to install Twine:

Windows: py -m pip install --upgrade twine
Linux: python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine



Installing Local
python setup.py install
